#E-commerce app

#This project is a basic e-commerce web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes user authentication (signup, login, logout) with data stored in localStorage, a product catalog fetched from the FakeStoreAPI with search and filter features (plus optional CRUD for admins), and a shopping cart that supports checkout with unique order IDs, order storage, and optional order history and promo codes. An admin dashboard (optional) allows restricted access to stats and product/order management. The app is organized into separate HTML, CSS, and JS files for each feature.
